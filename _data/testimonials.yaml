    "Flyte is quickly becoming a workhorse at Freenome. The regular cadence of high quality backward-compatible releases,
    quick turnarounds on bug fixes, realtime support on Slack, and a vibrant community of helpful power users across many

    "Open source projects can be challenging, particularly when there are communication gaps, delays, or roadblocks
    in applying larger changes or supporting new use cases. Contributing to flyte.org was an incredibly streamlined,
    supportive, and collaborative experience. Haytham and Ketan were extremely helpful as I implemented my original
    idea; they shared feedback quickly and added me to the Github organization, so I could run CI builds. They
    are great at encouraging new contributors and new ideas while also maintaining the product vision and high
    code quality."

    "The Flyte community has been invaluable as we learn to utilize Flyte’s capabilities. My myriad of questions
    have all been answered thoughtfully and promptly. The Flyte team has encouraged my feedback throughout this
    process, and have incorporated it into their documentation and roadmaps. After only a few weeks of engagement
    with Flyte, I feel I am a member of the Flyte community now too."

    "I had a great experience working with the Flyte community. It is amazing how quickly the community has grown
    and how fast the product evolves. Ketan has been super helpful and responsive when I try to build a proof of
    concept based on Flyte. I particularly like the community sync to keep the community updated on the latest
    and get feedback. I see high potential for Flyte and its community."

    "The community is super responsive, it generally takes no more than 24 hours to receive an answer to a
    question or jump on a Meet to troubleshoot. I watch every meetup asynchronously when I'm awake. The other
    thing is providing pathways for people's contributions. eg: supporting folks with an RFC, and being really
    responsive merging PRs (again < 24 hours)."
